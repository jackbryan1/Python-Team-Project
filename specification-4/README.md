Specification 4
=====
About
-----

Specification 4 is a unique specification in that there isnt a particular python library to use, so there is complete creative freedom 

How to Use
-------

example command:

pipenv run python specification-4\start.py test test hash

can also write compare instead of hash \
anything can be written in place of either test

What the code does
-----

The code allows the user to type in a password and have it encrypted and stored. The user can then type in a password to check it against the stored passwords.

How this solution meets the specification
-----

We researched different python libraries and chose Bcrypt to use. We checked that this is not similar to any existing specifications, and then we started working on the code.
