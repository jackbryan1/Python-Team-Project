### Specification 2

In this challenge, you are going to be exploring image manipulation
using the Pillow Python library. Write a program that modifies a
selection of images of various sizes and file formats and converts
them to JPEG thumbnails. Your program should allow the user to apply a
selection of modifications to an image and then store the modified
image. To be able to modify images in this way, you will have to make
use of the Pillow Python library. This library is a fork of the Python
Imaging Library (PIL), so much of the existing functionality is still
there, however, the library has been expanded further.

After you completed the core features of the program, expand your
program by experimenting with different features of the Pillow library
and showing your results. For example, you could manipulate the
specific RGB values of each pixel of an image. If applicable, make
sure to discuss what features you have experimented with in your
individual report.

#### Objectives

* Read in image files and store them in an appropriate collection
  ready for modification.
* Convert the images to thumbnails and name the new files
  appropriately.
* Apply various filters to the images using the *ImageFilter* module.
* Modify the RGB values of images to produce a new filter.
* Experiment with the Pillow library and its modules and save what you
  have produced.

#### Learning Outcomes

* To be able to investigate a library's documentation page to produce
  code that satisfies an objective.
* To be able to handle the reading and writing of files.
* To be able to explore the various applications of a library's
  modules to produce different results.
* To use your knowledge of traversing collections to explore the
  different properties of an image.
* To use your understanding of a library and produce something
  creative.

#### Concepts to consider

* Image IO
* Collections
* Sorting and traversal of collections
* Conditionals
  
#### Libraries to investigate

* [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

Specification 2
====================

This package allows creating thumbnails with 512x512 sizes and applies the filters: emboss, contour, smooth, black and white.

## Installation

The [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package is used in this project

## Usage

```thumbnail```
creates thumbnails of pictures in "spec2-images" folder

```emboss```
applies the emboss filter on pictures in "spec2-images" folder

```contour```
applies the contour filter on pictures in "spec2-images" folder

```smooth```
applies the smooth filter on pictures in "spec2-images" folder

```bw```
creates black and white versions of pictures in "spec2-images" folder

After using a command you will receive a prompt asking if the program should display the newly created images. 

```yes``` ```y``` ```y``` ``` ``` displays every image

```no``` ```n``` closes the program
